🔗 Blockchain-Based Identity Management System
🧠 Overview

The Blockchain-Based Identity Management System is a decentralized web application developed using Flask (Python) and launched via Anaconda environment on localhost. It enables educational institutions to issue and verify academic credentials securely using blockchain technology.

By integrating smart contracts, cryptographic hashing, and a user-friendly web interface, this project ensures data integrity, transparency, and tamper-proof credential storage, reducing verification time and eliminating manual validation errors.

⚙️ Key Features

🧾 Decentralized Credential Verification: Ensures authenticity using blockchain.

⚡ Smart Contract Automation: Issues and validates credentials without manual intervention.

🔒 Tamper-Proof Record Keeping: Hash-based data protection using SHA-256.

🌐 Local Flask Web Interface: Deployed via Anaconda for local development and testing.

⛓️ Blockchain Integration: Uses Web3.py to connect the Flask app with the Ethereum network.

🏗️ System Workflow

Institution Registration: Admin registers and connects to the blockchain wallet.

Credential Issuance: The institution issues credentials that are hashed and stored on the blockchain.

Verification: Employers or users can verify credentials through a transaction ID or hash value.

Local Execution: Flask app runs locally via Anaconda environment and interacts with blockchain APIs.
